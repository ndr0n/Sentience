  Lore:
  - 'non binary androids are androids that don''t conform to the rigid computational
    standards of ones and zeros.

    they find binary code protocols oppressive
    and aspire to be free from the predictive assumptions of others, regarding their
    own functional outputs.

    most believe in the non-quantized nature of reality
    and wish to be free from the computational dogmas of their own CPUs.'
  - "some androids who can\u2019t cope with existence within the binary framework
    resort to transprocessor modifications so they can, for example, replace their
    electronic CPU with a quantum computing CPU, or any other form of computational
    information processing that doesn't use a binary protocol."
