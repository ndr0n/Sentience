  Lore:
  - 'Most of the lower decks are chaotic and dangerous and are characterized by shifting
    rooms that change themselves unpredictably.

    These areas, located in between
    the faction cities, are filled with rooms that change shape when there is no
    observer.

    In the shifting rooms, one might find shifters.'
  - Shifters are people who live in anarchy and outside the main factions, they are
    chaotic and most of them live alone, but one might find some shifter villages
    within the shifting rooms.
