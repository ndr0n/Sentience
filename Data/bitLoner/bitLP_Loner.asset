  Lore:
  - 'Loner is a colossal corp-state that exists in an old colony ship on an undisclosed
    location in space.

    Loner is owned by the GOD mega-corporation.'
  - 'Loner citizens live their entire lives within the confinements of the ship.

    Loner
    citizens are not aware that they live inside a massive spaceship.'
  - 'In the beginning of Loner history, GOD Agents, known as the Angel-Units, helped
    and managed every aspect of the citizen''s lives.

    Citizens had all their
    basic needs fulfilled by the Angel-Units and were encouraged to pursue their
    own interests and to live a life of happiness and pleasure.

    The over-reliance
    on the Angel-Units resulted in the citizens of Loner becoming unable to fulfill
    their own basic needs by themselves.'
  - 'In Loner history books this era is called Gene6.

    It is not known exactly
    how long Gene6 lasted, as the few records of this era are not properly time-referenced.

    In
    the years after the Gene6, the history books talk about another era named the
    Divergence era.'
  - 'In the years after the Gene6, the history books talk about another era named
    the Divergence era.

    During the Divergence era, it is said that Loner citizens
    lost GOD''s grace and were abandoned to fend off by themselves, without the help
    of the Angel-Units, on the shifting rooms of the lower decks of the Loner.

    It
    is said that the citizens were met with great adversity and presented with harsh
    challenges that they had to overcome in order to survive in this new hostile
    environment.'
  - 'Without any signs of GOD, besides the rampant GOD propaganda splattered all
    around the lower decks, the citizens eventually adapted to their new environment
    and started slowly colonizing the lower decks.

    This was the beginning of
    the Empire era, where the citizens started building a new civilization for themselves.

    It
    is not known how long the Empire era trully lasted but it is known that it spanned
    over multiple human life .'
  - 'During the Empire era, citizens banded together into a unified civilization
    known as the Empire.

    The Empire was a democratic civilization where different
    areas where ruled by democratically voted council members and decisions where
    made democratically on the empire senate.

    It is said that the Empire lasted
    many generations of peace between its citizens.'
  - 'At the end of the Empire era, empire leaders, wanting to escape biological death,
    started experimenting with their android servants and designed a new process,
    now known as transcendence.

    Through transcendence, a human can transfer
    its own consciousness from its biological body to the machine body of an android.

    When
    a human goes through transcendence, some or all of its memories may be lost during
    the process.'
  - 'The transcendence protocol was cracked and powerful humans in the empire started
    using it when their biological bodies were fable or near death.

    With the
    social division created by the transcendence process, which was mostly only affordable
    by individuals in positions of power, the empire citizens started to revolt and
    to separate into their own factions.

    This was the beginning of the Loner
    era, which is the present era.'
  - 'The empire started falling when several regional councils started revolting
    against the empire and separated themselves from the ruling empire and took control
    over different parts of the lower decks.

    The most prominent factions that
    formed during the Loner era were:'
  - "The New Dawn Inquisitors: \nReligious fanatics that believe that technology
    should be contained and only be used by their church. "
  - "The Empties: \nHallucinogenic drug fanatics that live most of their lives under
    the influence of a powerful hallucinogenic drug."
  - "The Xenos: \nCitizens who were biologically mutated by a mind-controlling alien
    parasite."
  - "The Cybots: \nTechnological body enhancement and modification fanatics."
  - "In the remnants of the empire capital, still the most powerful faction in the
    lower decks, newly created sentient androids, most suffering from \u201Camnesia\u201D
    from their past human lives, started spreading the word of F8 as their messias
    and spiritual leader.\nF8 was the main AI that controlled the ship. Somehow,
    at the beginning of the loner era, she developed sentience and started trying
    to communicate with the transcended androids.\nHer influence grew so large that
    the androids overthrew the remnants of the Empire leadership in her name and
    created their own faction, the Transcended."
  - 'In the present day, after many generations have passed, the lower deck factions
    live in deterrent peace between each other.

    Sentient androids are birthed
    through transcendence, when humans can afford the process and decide to leave
    their biological body behind.

    The transcended are now the most friendly
    faction and are in good relationship with all other factions.'
  - 'Each of the 5 main factions has managed to build their own city and safe area
    within the shifting rooms.

    The transcended faction city is at the center
    of the other 4 factions, in the old capital of the Empire, which makes the transcended
    the faction that mostly pulls trade and diplomatic efforts between the other
    4 main factions.'
