  Lore:
  - "A corporate state, also known as a corp-state, is a \u201Cspace country\u201D
    existing inside a spaceship, usually owned by a mega-corporation.\nPeople that
    are born within a corporate state are citizens of that state and are forced to
    lived under its rules.\nCorp-states are usually created by mega-corporations
    who want to live outside of established political rules."
  - "Since space is a \u201Cno man\u2019s land\u201D, corp-states do not fall under
    any jurisdiction besides their own.\nCorp-states are recognized by inter-galactic
    law and have their own rights and sovereignty.\nThese states are usually created 
    when a mega-corporation builds or takes hold of a colony ship."
  - Most known corp-states are secretive and usually closed off from the outside
    universe.
